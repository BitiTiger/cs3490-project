I'll do some explaining, what you see below is a YAML configuration for pandoc,
a tool that I use to convert markdown to any document format. People tend to
like the style of pandoc when exported and it looks a lot like the instruction
documents that professors will hand out to students.

NOTE: This text is inside HTML comment tags and will not be parsed by pandoc.
We could write anything we want in here and nobody will see it in the generated
pdf file.

# List of things to add

- What will your program do? State precisely the problem that it will solve.
- What will the user interaction look like? How will the program take the input?
- How will it return the output to the user?
- What datatypes will be used internally by the program? How will the inputs
  be parsed into internal representations?
- Give a brief outline of the process by which the program will attain its
  goal. A good answer could include the datatype(s) definition, a list of
  functions to be implemented, a one-line description of what each function
  does, and pseudocode for a “main” method that will call them in sequence.
  (At this point, you do not have to give the pseudocode for individual
  functions.)
- If you intend to work in a group, list the name(s) of who you will work with.
